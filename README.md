A package to download and manipulate data from the Public Libraries Survey, conducted by the Institute of Museum and Library Services

## Motivation

The public libraries survey (PLS) is a yearly survey sent to libraries around the United States. This survey records the number of open locations, the number and hours of employment, and the number of resources available to the public.  
These yearly surveys can be used to explore trends in the library system, however, the data format and shape provided by the PLS has changed through time. This project provides some helper funtions to clean and reformat these data into a shape that is appropriate for temporal and spatial comparison.
